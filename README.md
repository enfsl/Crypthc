# Crypthc

crypthc uses checksum packages from linux side (sha256sum, sha512sum, sha1sum, md5sum)

this makes it superior to checksum tools running on windows.
Because it can finish checksum operations faster.

requirements
- Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

you need to know
- if you get the error, make sure that the bash.exe file is in the debug folder
- debug folder has bash.exe but you get an error; You can copy bash.exe from the System32 folder and paste it into the debug folder.

it was my first project(very small project), I like it if you want to contribute :)
